Overview
---------
 - Airfoil Tool Suite is a collection of tools for airfoil analysis and modification, developed by Andrew Mistele
 - This project is being devloped with MATLAB R2018b. Compatibility with older versions of MATLAB has not been tested
 - All dependencies are contained within the repository

 - Tools are selected and run from the main menu window, which also has the airfoil buffer manager
	- When a tool is run, the airfoil buffer is copied over to the active tool's airfoil buffer

Main Menu
---------
 - Running "main.m" opens the main menu for this tool
 - From the main menu, airfoils can be loaded in using the right panel
	- Note that airfoil coordinates must be in the Selig format with no header lines
 - Once airfoils of interest are loaded in, airfoil tools can be launched with these airfoils buffered using the left panel

Tools
---------
 - autoXFOIL   : automates XFOIL runs and data processing and formatting
	       - useful for batch runs and sweeps across flight conditions
 - CamberUtils : airfoil geometry tool. Airfoil coordinate files can be deconstructed into camber and thickness distributions
	       - camber and thickness distributions can be saved, scaled, and/or added to a buffer
               - camber and thickness distributions can be read in to the buffer
               - from the buffer, airfoil distributions can be scaled and/or interchanged with other airfoils and reconstructed to form new airfoils
 - LERfinder   : GUI for estimating leading-edge radius of airfoils, a parameter used for aerodynamics and survivability
