Excerpt from XFOIL documentation:


                -- Transition criterion --

Transition in an XFOIL solution is triggered by one of two ways:

  free  transition:  e^n criterion is met
 forced transition:  a trip or the trailing edge is encountered

The e^n method is always active, and free transition can occur
upstream of the trip.  The e^n method has the user-specified 
parameter "Ncrit", which is the log of the amplification factor
of the most-amplified frequency which triggers transition.
A suitable value of this parameter depends on the ambient
disturbance level in which the airfoil operates, and mimics
the effect of such disturbances on transition.  Below are typical 
values of Ncrit for various situations.

     situation             Ncrit
  -----------------        -----
  sailplane                12-14
  motorglider              11-13
  clean wind tunnel        10-12
  average wind tunnel        9     <=  standard "e^9 method"
  dirty wind tunnel         4-8

Note: The e^n method in XFOIL is actually the simplified envelope 
version, which is the same as the full e^n method only for flows 
with constant H(x). If H is not constant, the two methods differ
somewhat, but this difference is typically within the uncertainty
in choosing Ncrit.

The e^n method is only appropriate for predicting transition in 
situations where the growth of 2-D Tollmien-Schlichting waves via
linear instability is the dominant transition-initiating mechanism.  
Fortunately, this happens to be the case in a vast majority of airfoil 
applications.  Other possible mechanisms are:

* Crossflow instabilities. These occur on swept wings with significant  
  favorable chordwise pressure gradients.

* Attachment-line transition.  This requires large sweep, large LE
  radius, and a large Reynolds number.  Occurs primarily on big jets.

* Bypass transition.  This occurs in cases with sufficient wall
  roughness and/or large freestream turbulence or vibration levels.
  The linear-instability phase predicted by the e^n method is
  "bypassed", giving relatively early transition.  Usually occurs
  in favorable pressure gradients, while the linear-instability
  mechanism usually dominates in adverse pressure gradients.

If any of these alternative transition mechanisms are present, the
trips must be set to mimick their effect.  The bypass transition
mechanism can be mimicked to some extent by the e^n method by 
setting Ncrit to a small value --- Ncrit=1 or less.  This will 
cause transition just after linear instability begins.  For
very large freestream turbulence or roughness in favorable
pressure gradients, bypass transition can occur before the 
linear instability threshold, and in this case trips will have 
to be set as well.
